# 🔥 Top 30 Java Interview Questions for Freshers (Basic to Advanced) 💪

Listen up. These aren't just random questions—this is what separates developers who get hired from those who get rejected. Master these, or stay mediocre. Your choice.

## ⚡ Basic Java Fundamentals (Questions 1-10)

**1. What is Java and why is it platform-independent? 🌐**

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), allowing "write once, run anywhere" capability because compiled bytecode executes on any platform with a JVM installed.

**2. What are the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM? 🛠️**

JDK (Java Development Kit) contains development tools including compiler; JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides libraries and JVM to run applications; JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes bytecode and provides platform independence.

**3. What are the main features of Java? ✨**

Platform independence, object-oriented, robust (strong memory management and exception handling), secure, multithreaded, architecture-neutral, portable, high performance with JIT compiler, and distributed computing support.

**4. What are the four pillars of OOP? 🏛️**

Encapsulation (bundling data and methods), Inheritance (acquiring properties from parent class), Polymorphism (same method behaving differently), and Abstraction (hiding implementation details).

**5. What is the difference between a class and an object? 📦**

A class is a blueprint or template that defines properties and behaviors; an object is an instance of a class that exists in memory with actual values.

**6. What are primitive data types in Java? 🔢**

Eight primitive types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`. They store actual values directly in memory, unlike objects which store references.

**7. What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java? ⚖️**

`==` compares memory references (addresses) for objects or values for primitives; `.equals()` compares the actual content/value of objects. For Strings, `==` checks if they point to the same memory location while `.equals()` checks if content is identical.

**8. What is a constructor in Java? 🏗️**

A special method with the same name as the class, called automatically when an object is created, used to initialize object state. No return type, can be overloaded, default constructor provided if none defined.

**9. What are access modifiers in Java? 🔐**

`public` (accessible everywhere), `private` (accessible only within class), `protected` (accessible within package and subclasses), and default/package-private (accessible within package only).

**10. What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer? 📝**

`String` is immutable (unchangeable); `StringBuilder` is mutable and not thread-safe (faster for single-threaded operations); `StringBuffer` is mutable and thread-safe (synchronized, slower but safe for multi-threaded environments).

## 🚀 Intermediate Concepts (Questions 11-20)

**11. What is inheritance and what are its types? 🧬**

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class. Types: Single (one parent), Multilevel (chain inheritance), Hierarchical (multiple children from one parent). Java doesn't support multiple inheritance with classes but achieves it through interfaces.

**12. What is polymorphism? Explain compile-time vs runtime polymorphism. 🎭**

Polymorphism means "many forms." Compile-time (method overloading): same method name, different parameters. Runtime (method overriding): subclass provides specific implementation of parent class method, decided at runtime through dynamic method dispatch.

**13. What is encapsulation? 🔒**

Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit and restricting direct access to some components using access modifiers. Achieved by making variables private and providing public getter/setter methods.

**14. What is the difference between abstract class and interface? 🎯**

Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, constructors, instance variables, any access modifiers. Interface (before Java 8) had only abstract methods; (Java 8+) can have default and static methods; variables are public, static, final by default. A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class.

**15. What are static variables and methods? 🔧**

Static members belong to the class rather than instances. Static variables are shared among all objects; static methods can be called without creating objects and can only access static members directly.

**16. What are final variables, methods, and classes? 🚫**

`final` variable: constant, cannot be reassigned. `final` method: cannot be overridden by subclasses. `final` class: cannot be inherited/extended.

**17. What is exception handling in Java? Explain try-catch-finally. ⚠️**

Mechanism to handle runtime errors. `try` block contains code that might throw exception; `catch` block handles specific exceptions; `finally` block executes regardless of exception occurrence (used for cleanup). `throw` throws exception manually; `throws` declares exceptions a method might throw.

**18. What are checked vs unchecked exceptions? 🐛**

Checked exceptions (compile-time): must be handled or declared (IOException, SQLException). Unchecked exceptions (runtime): not mandatory to handle (NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException).

**19. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList? 📋**

`ArrayList` uses dynamic array (fast random access O(1), slow insertion/deletion O(n)); `LinkedList` uses doubly-linked list (slow access O(n), fast insertion/deletion O(1) at ends). ArrayList better for retrieval-heavy operations; LinkedList better for frequent insertions/deletions.

**20. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet? 🌳**

`HashSet` uses hashing (unordered, allows one null, O(1) operations); `TreeSet` uses Red-Black tree (sorted order, no nulls, O(log n) operations). Use HashSet for fast operations; TreeSet when you need sorted elements.

## 💎 Advanced Topics (Questions 21-30)

**21. What are lambda expressions in Java 8? 🔥**

Concise way to represent anonymous functions (methods without names). Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements; }`. Used to implement functional interfaces. Example: `(a, b) -> a + b` for addition. Enables functional programming style.

**22. What is the Optional class in Java 8? 🎁**

Container object used to represent the presence or absence of a value, helps avoid `NullPointerException`. Methods: `isPresent()`, `ifPresent()`, `orElse()`, `orElseGet()`.

**23. What are default and static methods in interfaces (Java 8+)? 🆕**

`default` methods provide implementation in interfaces (backward compatibility); `static` methods belong to interface itself, not implementations. Allows adding new methods without breaking existing implementations.

**24. What is multithreading in Java? Explain thread lifecycle. 🧵**

Concurrent execution of multiple threads. Thread states: New → Runnable → Running → Blocked/Waiting → Terminated. Create threads by extending `Thread` class or implementing `Runnable`/`Callable` interface.

**25. What is synchronization in Java? 🔄**

Mechanism to control access of multiple threads to shared resources, preventing race conditions. `synchronized` keyword on methods or blocks ensures only one thread executes at a time.

**26. What is garbage collection in Java? 🗑️**

Automatic memory management where JVM identifies and removes unreferenced objects to free memory. Garbage collector runs as daemon thread. Methods: `System.gc()` suggests GC (not guaranteed).

**27. What is method overloading vs method overriding? 🔀**

Overloading (compile-time polymorphism): same method name, different parameters in same class. Overriding (runtime polymorphism): subclass provides specific implementation of parent class method with exact same signature.

**28. What are wrapper classes? 🎁**

Object representations of primitive types: `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`, etc. Enable primitives to be used where objects are required (Collections). Autoboxing: automatic conversion primitive to wrapper; Unboxing: wrapper to primitive.

**29. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy? 📋**

Shallow copy copies object references (both objects share same referenced objects). Deep copy creates new copies of referenced objects (completely independent objects).

**30. Explain Java Collections Framework hierarchy. 📚**

Root interface: `Collection`. Main interfaces: `List` (ordered, duplicates allowed - ArrayList, LinkedList), `Set` (unordered, no duplicates - HashSet, TreeSet), `Queue` (FIFO - PriorityQueue). `Map` interface (key-value pairs - HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap) is separate.

***

**💡 Pro tip:** Don't just memorize answers—understand the WHY behind each concept. Interviewers can smell superficial knowledge from a mile away. Practice coding these concepts, not just reading about them. If you can't write code demonstrating these principles in under 2 minutes, you're not ready. Period.
