## **Key Concepts Freshers MUST Know** ✅

### **Database Decisions** 💾

**Use SQL when:**

- Need ACID transactions
- Complex relationships (joins)
- Structured data

**Use NoSQL when:**

- High write throughput
- Horizontal scaling required
- Flexible schema


### **When to Use Caching** ⚡

- **80% reads, 20% writes** → Cache aggressively
- Hot data (frequently accessed)
- Reduce database load


### **Common Bottlenecks** 🚧

- Database (solution: sharding, replication)
- Single server (solution: load balancer)
- Network latency (solution: CDN, caching)

***

## **What NOT to Do** ❌

**DON'T:**

- Jump into coding without clarifying requirements
- Over-engineer (keep it simple for fresher-level!)
- Ignore trade-offs (always explain WHY you chose something)
- Forget about scale (mention numbers - DAU, QPS)
- Design in silence (think out loud!)

**DO:**

- Ask questions first
- Start with high-level design
- Justify every component
- Discuss trade-offs
- Keep it conversational

***

## **Interview Red Flags (What Kills Your Chances)** 🚩

1. **Not asking ANY clarifying questions** - Shows you don't understand requirements
2. **Jumping to code immediately** - System design ≠ coding round
3. **Saying "I don't know"** without trying - Show your thought process
4. **Overcomplicating simple problems** - KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
5. **Not mentioning numbers** - "Scale" means nothing without numbers

***

## **Sample Answer Flow for URL Shortener** 🔗

**Step 1: Clarify** ❓

- "How many URLs per day?" → Let's say 100M
- "How long should URLs last?" → 10 years
- "Custom aliases allowed?" → No, just random
- "Analytics needed?" → Not for MVP

**Step 2: High-Level Design** 🎨

```
Client → Load Balancer → API Servers → Cache (Redis) → Database (NoSQL)
                                    ↓
                              Hashing Service
```

**Step 3: Deep Dive** 🔍

- **Encoding:** Base62 (0-9, a-z, A-Z) → 62^7 = 3.5 trillion combinations
- **Database:** DynamoDB (key-value, handles scale)
- **Cache:** Redis for hot URLs (80/20 rule)
- **Collision handling:** Check DB before inserting

**Step 4: Wrap Up** 🎁

- Can handle 100M URLs/day
- Latency < 100ms with caching
- Scalable with sharding if needed
- Future: Analytics, custom aliases

- Perfect answers ❌
- Complex architectures ❌

**System Design IS about:**

- Structured thinking ✅

## **Bonus: Cheat Sheet for Interviews** 📋

**When interviewer says "Design X":**

1. "Let me clarify the requirements first..." ❓

3. "Let me dive deeper into the database layer..." 🔍
4. "Here are some trade-offs I'm making..." ⚖️
5. "Let me address potential bottlenecks..." 🚧

**Magic phrases:**

- "To handle scale, we can..." 📈
- "The trade-off here is..." ⚖️
